# What is Wayclip?

Wayclip, is an open-source, community driven project, which aims at providing an easy way to get instant replays of your favourite moments. This tool is built for the Linux community, and works with [Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) and [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).

# Whats the story?

I myself, am a gamer, Arch user and a developer. Ive come across this issue where on linux distros, there werent many good and ready-to-use "clipping" solutions, that can provide you with instant replays.
I saw this as a great opportunity and started slaving away on my own implemnetation. After months of work, research and pain I have finally achieved a *somewhat* working version of Wayclip.
Since then this has grown from a small idea, to a full on ecosyste, with its own CLI, rust library, API, docker containers, and much more.

As I was building and developing Wayclip, I followed a single, simple idea: **to make something, that I would use daily**

# Where to download?

Currently Wayclip provides only a few methods of installation, but we slowly expand. Reffer to this table to know the current status of downloads for your system. You can find all the appropriate download links [here](/download).

# Core features

Wayclip provides many features for our users:
- Instant replay. Record your screen in any quality, size and variation, and save the last few moments with a single hot-key.
- Clip sharing. We provide access to sharing your clips for all users, where you can upload it to our API, and share the link easily in discord, or anywhere else.
- Self-Hostable. I personally think that this is a really important feature for Wayclip, as it allows to run your own backend for full control over everything. (*🚧 Work in progress 🚧*)
- Cloud Storage. Each free user recieves 2GB of cloud storage, for sharing and saving clips on our API. Note: This is entirley optional, and you can save your clips locally

# Eco system

Wayclip has an extensive eco-system and I will quickly run through how everything works at the surface level.

## Wayclip Core

I have developed a `wayclip_core` rust crate. In this crate you can find all the useful libraries which are used extensively throughout the other applications.
In addition to the crate, `wayclip_core` is also responsible for providing the daemon and trigger binaries. These binaries are then fetched dynamically (AUR & Install script),
or baked (.deb) straight into the CLI for further use. Everything relies on the `wayclip_core` part. If you want to explore more, visit [Wayclip Core repository](https://github.com/Wayclip/core)

## Wayclip CLI

The CLI for Wayclip, was made to have *an* option to use Wayclip, while the GUI is being developed. Now, I think that the CLI might overcome the GUI entirely due to the simplistic design and ease of use.
The CLI allows for *most* functions of the upcoming GUI application, for example, video cropping, sharing, searching, deleting, etc... The CLI is built entirely in Rust, and is actually awaiting a rewrite (as is most of the project).
You can read more about the CLI [here](/docs/cli), or go technical by going over to the [Wayclip CLI repository](https://github.com/Wayclip/cli)

## Wayclip GUI

Wayclip GUI is an upcoming module for Wayclip, which will be a Tuari application, providing a useful interface for managing, editing and uploading your clips. The development of this is ongoing, but has its own problems.
For starters, Im developing it on Wayland, with an NVIDIA GPU, and if you tried this before, you KNOW its very painful. I will find a solution to this, and build the GUI after bringing up the rest of my eco system up to standart.
I think that focusing on making a better daemon, cli is more important than a cool UI. UX > UI :).
Current time frame for the GUI: ~3 months.

## Wayclip API

The API for wayclip is built with rust, and [actix-web](https://actix.rs/). The API is one of the main components of this project, as it handles auth, sharing, storage, and everythig else.
Currently, the API is not *fully* self-hostable, but I am doing my best. Find out more in the [Wayclip API repository](https://github.com/Wayclip/api)

## Wayclip Dashboard

There is also a [dashboard](https://dash.wayclip.com) for Wayclip, which is responsible for managing your account, including all the clips and subscriptions in the browser. For admins, this is a powerful tool for controling all your users, subscriptions, storage and reports.
The dashboard is not the best, and certainly needs improvement, but feel free to use it, as it works. Find out more about it over at the [Wayclip Dash repository](https://github.com/Wayclip/dash)


## Wayclip Docs

I am using [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) for the documentation side of Wayclip. I am trying my best to keep this documentation relevant, and up to date. For contributing to the docs, visit [Waylcip Docs repository](https://github.com/Wayclip/docs)

# Pricing & Subscription models

A subscription is **NOT MANDATORY** to use Wayclip. When purchasing a subscription, you get an increased amount of cloud storage, allowing for more clips to be hosted, as well as other premium features (which I will add later).
The subscription model goes, as following:

- Free plan - 2GB storage, all normal features
- Basic plan (3.99$/month) - 50GB storage
- Plus plan (8.99$/month) - 200GB storage
- Pro plan (13.99$/month) - 1TB storage

All subscriptions are managed through stripe, and you can get one by creating an account in the [dashboard](https://dash.wayclip.com)

# Open Source & community

All parts of wayclip are licensed under [**MIT**](https://github.com/Wayclip/core/blob/main/LICENSE). We encourage you to dive deep into the code, contribute, and suggest imporvemnets. Here are some useful resources for you:

- [Task tracking / TODO List](https://github.com/orgs/Wayclip/projects/1)

# AI & Vibe-coding

I have been working on this project by myself, and I consider using AI for its development is a necessity. I try to control myself and not develop EVERYTHING using it. To combat this, I have set out a plan to have a propper rewrite of all the modules in the future.
Hopefully, what I said here will not cause issues.
