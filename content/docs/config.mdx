# Configuration

Wayclip allows its users to customize how the CLI & daemon will behave, including the storage location paths, quality of videos & other useful features. In this guide we will go through the standard config that you may edit yourself.

## File structure

By default, the config path is `~/.config/wayclip/config.json`. The wayclip directory is also used to store the metadata of your clips in a `data.json` file, alongside the clip previews (for the upcoming GUI).
As of current moment, the file structure of the location of the config and the metadata is hardcoded, and most likely won't change. You can edit the config file via your favourite editor, or by writing `wayclip-cli config`, if you have our CLI installed.
*Note: Missing or corrupted fields will be ignored & new ones will be created instead*

# Video settings

Let's go through the video settings that you can adjust to increase or decrease the quality of the clips recorded, alongside other information related to the clips themselves.

## Clip Name Formatting

`clip_name_formatting` field is responsible for naming all your clips. You can write anything you like, alongside placeholders like `%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S` which will be parsed according to the current time.
I am personally not aware of the full list of placeholders available, so experiment on your own.

## Clip Length

You can specify the duration for how long your recording will be buffered for. You can edit the field `clip_name_s` by specifying an integer value in seconds. I recommend going with about 2 minutes (120 seconds),
as it gives a good balance between performance and length. Please note that as you increase the video length, the RAM & VRAM usage **WILL** increase, and on lower-end machines, it may bottleneck or even cause crashes.

## Clip Resolution

By changing the `clip_resolution` you can specify to what resolution the captured frames will be formatted. The formatting for this field is as follows: `2560x1440`. Also, by increasing this field, the amount of resources used will increase.
Please also note that I am not confident that weird resolutions will work, or even look good, so please try at your own risk.

## Clip FPS

We can also alter how many frames are being captured per second by changing `clip_fps`. This should be an integer value, default is `60`. This will also affect performance.

## Video bitrate

Now, we have a video bitrate setting `video_bitrate`, which will be passed into the gstreamer pipeline, determining the **average** bitrate of the video clip. I am not guaranteeing that this setting works as expected, or that it will produce correct results.
Also, to determine if the setting is in `bps` or `kbps` refer to your GPU manufacturer and gstreamer documentation. I am using an NVIDIA GPU, so I *think* that it's in `kbps`, which is why the default is `15000`. Adjust this as you see fit.

## Video & Audio codec

You can adjust the `video_codec` and `audio_codec` settings, but again, at your own risk. I would just leave it as the default values of `h264` and `aac` respectively.
I do know that the code is designed to pick up the correct GPU settings and use the right codec. Just try it, I'm unsure about my own code (yes this is the sloppiest documentation ever) :)

## Save location

If you want to change where the clips are saved to, you can edit the `save_path_from_home_string` field. Which, as the name tells us, should be a string pointing to an existing directory starting from the home path. For example: `Videos/wayclip`.

# Misc settings

## Save Shortcut

Do not trust me on this, but you can edit the shortcut used for saving the clip in `save_shortcut`. But again, I might have accidentally hardcoded it to Alt+C for all distros. Default: `Alt+C`. Also, please refer to the logs when starting the daemon using `wayclip-cli daemon logs`,
as it will show you if the bind has been applied successfully. So far, I have tested on Arch + Hyprland setup, so it calls `hyprctl` and adds the bind there. The process may vary from distro to distro so please be aware. A table with all tested distros and systems will be added in the future.

<Callout>
If a bind has **NOT** been added, you can also use the `wayclip-cli save` command to trigger the saving process.

## Open GUI shortcut, Toggle Notifications and GUI Socket Path

Well, as the GUI is not released yet, these two settings are useless. You can just ignore them, but they are here now for my own sake of testing and developing.

## Daemon socket and process ID path.

It's best NOT to edit these paths, as they are critical for the daemon to work (even though I'm pretty sure I don't need the PID path AT ALL, still better be safe).

## Trigger path

This field will most likely be auto-regenerated at runtime since it searches for the `trigger` binary location which depends on the method of installation (AUR/Install Script).

## API URL

If you are self-hosting (which I will fix soon), you can also edit the `api_url` field which will alter the destination to which requests will be sent. Meaning Auth, Storage and much more can be handled through your own infra.

## Auth token

This value is constantly regenerated and re-used for the authentication system in the CLI. Just ignore this field.

# Audio

## Mic & Bg Node name

Wayclip pulls the default node name for your audio device from `pavucontrol` or anywhere else. Again, this may not work as expected, so edit these two fields as you wish. You can get more info on your audio devices through the following commands:
`pw-cli ls Node` & `pw-cli info <NodeID>`, or `pw-top`. You shall add the correct source/sink for the `mic_node_name` and `bg_node_name` settings from which the audio will be pulled during recording.

## Mic & Bg volume

You can adjust the percentage volume of each of the sources here. Has to be an integer value from 0-100. Edit the `mic_volume` and `bg_volume` settings to your liking. I recommend going `100/75`.

## Include Mic & Bg audio

You can also control which sources are being used in the recording, by adjusting the boolean value in the `include_bg_audio` and `include_mic_audio` fields.
